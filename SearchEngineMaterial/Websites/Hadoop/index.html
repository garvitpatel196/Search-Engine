      Apache Hadoop (pronunciation: /həˈduːp/) is an open-source software framework used for distributed storage and processing of big data sets using the MapReduce programming model. It consists of computer clusters built from commodity hardware. All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures are common occurrences and should be automatically handled by the framework.[2]

The core of Apache Hadoop consists of a storage part, known as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and a processing part which is a MapReduce programming model. Hadoop splits files into large blocks and distributes them across nodes in a cluster. It then transfers packaged code into nodes to process the data in parallel. This approach takes advantage of data locality,[3] where nodes manipulate the data they have access to. This allows the dataset to be processed faster and more efficiently than it would be in a more conventional supercomputer architecture that relies on a parallel file system where computation and data are distributed via high-speed networking.[4]

The base Apache Hadoop framework is composed of the following modules:

Hadoop Common – contains libraries and utilities needed by other Hadoop modules;
Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) – a distributed file-system that stores data on commodity machines, providing very high aggregate bandwidth across the cluster;
Hadoop YARN – a resource-management platform responsible for managing computing resources in clusters and using them for scheduling of users' applications;[5][6] and
Hadoop MapReduce – an implementation of the MapReduce programming model for large scale data processing.
The term Hadoop has come to refer not just to the base modules and sub-modules above, but also to the ecosystem,[7] or collection of additional software packages that can be installed on top of or alongside Hadoop, such as Apache Pig, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Phoenix, Apache Spark, Apache ZooKeeper, Cloudera Impala, Apache Flume, Apache Sqoop, Apache Oozie, Apache Storm.[8]

Apache Hadoop's MapReduce and HDFS components were inspired by Google papers on their MapReduce and Google File System.[9]

The Hadoop framework itself is mostly written in the Java programming language, with some native code in C and command line utilities written as shell scripts. Though MapReduce Java code is common, any programming language can be used with "Hadoop Streaming" to implement the "map" and "reduce" parts of the user's program.[10] Other projects in the Hadoop ecosystem expose richer user interfaces.

    <h5>
      Hadoop consists of the Hadoop Common package, which provides file system and OS level abstractions, a MapReduce engine (either MapReduce/MR1 or YARN/MR2)[58] and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The Hadoop Common package contains the necessary Java ARchive (JAR) files and scripts needed to start Hadoop.

For effective scheduling of work, every Hadoop-compatible file system should provide location awareness: the name of the rack (more precisely, of the network switch) where a worker node is. Hadoop applications can use this information to execute code on the node where the data is, and, failing that, on the same rack/switch to reduce backbone traffic. HDFS uses this method when replicating data for data redundancy across multiple racks. This approach reduces the impact of a rack power outage or switch failure; if one of these hardware failures occurs, the data will remain available.[59]

Hadoop cluster
A multi-node Hadoop cluster
A small Hadoop cluster includes a single master and multiple worker nodes. The master node consists of a Job Tracker, Task Tracker, NameNode, and DataNode. A slave or worker node acts as both a DataNode and TaskTracker, though it is possible to have data-only worker nodes and compute-only worker nodes. These are normally used only in nonstandard applications.[60]

Hadoop requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.6 or higher. The standard startup and shutdown scripts require that Secure Shell (ssh) be set up between nodes in the cluster.[61]

In a larger cluster, HDFS nodes are managed through a dedicated NameNode server to host the file system index, and a secondary NameNode that can generate snapshots of the namenode's memory structures, thereby preventing file-system corruption and loss of data. Similarly, a standalone JobTracker server can manage job scheduling across nodes. When Hadoop MapReduce is used with an alternate file system, the NameNode, secondary NameNode, and DataNode architecture of HDFS are replaced by the file-system-specific equivalents.

      History
    </h2>
    <h5>
      The genesis of Hadoop came from the Google File System paper[11] that was published in October 2003. This paper spawned another research paper from Google – MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters.[12] Development started on the Apache Nutch project, but was moved to the new Hadoop subproject in January 2006.[13] Doug Cutting, who was working at Yahoo! at the time,[14] named it after his son's toy elephant.[15] The initial code that was factored out of Nutch consisted of 5k lines of code for HDFS and 6k lines of code for MapReduce.

The first committer added to the Hadoop project was Owen O’Malley in March 2006.[16] Hadoop 0.1.0 was released in April 2006[17] and continues to evolve by the many contributors[18] to the Apache Hadoop project.
