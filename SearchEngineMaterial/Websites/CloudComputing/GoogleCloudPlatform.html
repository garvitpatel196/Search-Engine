     Google Cloud Platform, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search and YouTube.[1] Alongside a set of management tools, it provides, a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics and machine learning.[2]

      Cloud Platform gives you options for computing and hosting. You can choose to work with a managed application platform, leverage container technologies to gain lots of flexibility, or build your own cloud-based infrastructure to have the most control and flexibility. You can imagine a spectrum where, at one end, you have most of the responsibilities for resource management and, at the other end, Google has most of those responsibilities:

      Overview

    <h5>
     Google App Engine is Cloud Platform's platform as a service (PaaS). With App Engine, Google handles most of the management of the resources for you. For example, if your application requires more computing resources because traffic to your website increases, Google automatically scales the system to provide those resources. If the system software needs a security update, that's handled for you, too.

When you build your app on App Engine, you can:

Build your app on top of the App Engine standard environment runtimes in the languages that the standard environment supports, including: Python 2.7, Java 7, PHP, and Go.
Build your app on top of the App Engine flexible environment runtimes in the languages that App Engine flexible supports, including: Python 2.7/3.4, Java 8, Go, Node.js, and Ruby. Or use custom runtimes to use an alternative implementation of a supported language or any other language.
Let Google manage app hosting, scaling, monitoring and infrastructure for you.
Use the App Engine SDK to develop and test on your local machine in an environment that simulates App Engine on Cloud Platform.
Easily use the storage technologies that App Engine is designed to support in the standard and flexible environments.

Google Cloud SQL is your SQL database, supporting either MySQL or PostgreSQL. App Engine Datastore is your schemaless, NoSQL datastore. Google Cloud Storage provides space for your large files.

In the standard environment, you can also choose from a variety of third-party databases to use with your applications such as Redis, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Hadoop.

In the flexible environment, you can easily use any third-party database supported by your language, if the database is accessible from the Google App Engine instance.

In either environment, these third-party databases can be hosted on Compute Engine, hosted on another cloud provider, hosted on-premises, or managed by a third- party vendor.
Use Cloud Endpoints in the standard environment to generate APIs and client libraries that you can use to simplify data access from other applications. Endpoints makes it easier to create a web backend for web clients and mobile clients, such as Android or iOS.
Use built-in, managed services for activities such as email and user management.
Use Cloud Security Scanner to identify security vulnerabilities as a complement to your existing secure design and development processes.
Deploy your app by using the App Engine launcher GUI application on Mac OS X or Microsoft Windows or by using the command line.
For the standard environment, run your app from the Central US or Western Europe regions.
For a complete list and description of App Engine's features, see the App Engine documentation.

Containers

With container-based computing, you can focus on your application code, instead of on deployments and integration into hosting environments. Google Container Engine is built on the open source Kubernetes system, which gives you the flexibility of on-premises or hybrid clouds, in addition to Cloud Platform's public cloud infrastructure.

When you build with Container Engine, you can:

Create and manage groups of Compute Engine instances running Kubernetes, called clusters. Container Engine uses Compute Engine instances as nodes in a cluster. Each node runs the Docker runtime, a Kubelet agent that monitors the health of the node, and a simple network proxy.
Declare the requirements for your Docker containers by creating a simple JSON configuration file.
Use Google Container Registry for secure, private storage of Docker images. You can push images to your registry and then you can pull images to any Compute Engine instance or your own hardware by using an HTTP endpoint.
Create single- and multi-container pods. Each pod represents a logical host that can contain one or more containers. Containers in a pod work together by sharing resources, such as networking resources. Together, a set of pods might comprise an entire application, a micro-service, or one layer in a multi-tier application.
Create and manage replication controllers, which manage the creation and deletion of pod replicas based on a template. Replication controllers help to ensure that your application has the resources it needs to run reliably and scale appropriately.
Create and manage services. Services create an abstraction layer that decouples frontend clients from pods that provide backend functions. In this way, clients can work without concerns about which pods are being created and deleted at any given moment.
Create an external network load balancer.
